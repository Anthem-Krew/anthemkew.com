## We are the 96 percent. We believe we are the majority.
Companies, organisations and society must restructure the way they operate os they benefit and reflect everyone they serve and the environment they operate in.

## We believe the best solutions are achieved together.
No one group has a monopoly on the truth and best solutions. We arrive at better outcomes when we are all involved in the decision-making process.

## We believe the time is now.
Solutions must be implemented now to address inequality and under-representation. The wait for  a more equal society and better representation. The wait for a more equal society and better representation for all has been far too long.

## We believe in the power of allies.
People in positions of privilege and influence must demonstrate how they actively support others to address inequality.

## We believe in individuality.
Those in power must recognise that we are all human beings and not just convenient boxes to be ticked. As individuals we demand recognition, and for our true potential to be realised and rewarded.

## We believe in structural change.
Structural solutions sove systemic problems. We are fighthing against cosmetic changes that have no substantive impact (fake diversity). We reject lip service and demand real engagement.

## We believe in setting specific measurable goals.
All goals and targets must be measurable in order for those in charge to be held accountable. There must be tangible consequences if the objectives are not met.

## We are fighting for a power share, not a power grab.
This is not just a battle to erase the symptoms of all forms of prejudice. We demand a fundamental change in the status quo, an equal share and access to real power and how it is distributed throughout society. Whether you're a company, an organisation or a publicly funded institution, these issues concern you. So what are you going to do about it?
